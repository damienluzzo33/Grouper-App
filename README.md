# Description

Are you new to Austin, TX? Are you looking for a convenient way to connect with people with shared interests? Tired of the complex way in which similar apps like Meet-Up operate? Bored of trying to make new friends by going to Starbucks? Then this is the app for you! 

The Grouper App was designed to allow users of all backgrounds to create events that bring together individuals with similar interests. This is the perfect way to connect strangers and friends both during and after the pandemic. Users can create a new event or they can RSVP for an existing event both in-person and virtually. 

Grouper is an application based in Austin, Texas that aims to helps people create remote or in-person events so that users can easily and efficiently connect with friends and make new ones. Our mission is simple: create a simple way to allow folks to get together while doing something they love, like playing Dungeons and Dragons or Super Smash Brothers.
